IDEAS TODO

- Find out when a song was skipped => find all occurrences of the song to deduce
its total duration. Whenever that song was played a shorter time (lets give it
some percentual margin)AND another song started right away, it was skipped.
- Connect the streaming data to the playlists in some way
